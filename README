This is a program I have used for years to prepare examples for students,
and that they can use to prepare descriptions and downloads for me.

It creates listings of the programs (colorization soon to come),
and any other file you care to give, and allows you to provide
a preface (in your own html or in MarkDown -- recently added under the
influence of GitHub:-).  Soon I expect to allow you to use MarkDown to
comment individually on each listing.

The listings each are prefixed with a caret so you can return to the
original list, and go on to the next one.  This is convenient for code
readthroughs and such.

This uses the wonderful package MarkdownJ for doing the markdown.
